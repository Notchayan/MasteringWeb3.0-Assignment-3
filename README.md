# MasteringWeb3.0-Assignment-3
## ReactJs Learning Assignment

 This assignment is designed to challenge your React skills and push you to understand and implement advanced concepts. Be prepared for a rigorous and rewarding experience.

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to build a fully functional web application using React. The web application you will be creating is a **Weather Dashboard**. This application will allow users to register, log in, view weather data for different cities, and receive real-time weather updates. You will integrate various features and ensure the application is robust, efficient, and user-friendly. This assignment will help you solidify your understanding of React, component architecture, state management, and API integration.

## Requirements

### Core Features:
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement a user authentication system with registration, login, and logout functionalities.
   - Use JWT tokens for secure authentication.
   - Integrate third-party authentication (Google, Facebook).

2. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - Use React Router to implement dynamic routing.
   - Ensure that certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

3. **State Management:**
   - Implement global state management using Redux or Context API.
   - Manage state efficiently across different components and routes.

4. **API Integration:**
   - Integrate with a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, GitHub API).
   - Fetch and display data dynamically based on user input or interaction.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.
   - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI, or write custom CSS.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for API requests, form submissions, and other user interactions.
   - Display user-friendly error messages.

### Advanced Features:
1. **Real-time Data:**
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).
   - Example: A chat application or a live notification system.

2. **Unit and Integration Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Implement integration tests to ensure different parts of your application work together seamlessly.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize your application for performance.
   - Use techniques like code-splitting, lazy loading, and memoization.

4. **Custom Hooks:**
   - Create and use custom React hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic across different components.

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure your code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- Use Git for version control, committing your changes frequently.
- Write detailed commit messages to document your progress.
